# golibs
Golang libraries I use in my projects.

## Install
Import one of the following libraries in your Go code:  
- `github.com/outdead/golibs/extract` - to get pointer values
- `github.com/outdead/golibs/files` - to interact with the filesystem
- `github.com/outdead/golibs/format` - to format types to strings
